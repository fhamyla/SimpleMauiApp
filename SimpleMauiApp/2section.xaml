                Text="Operating systems have evolved significantly since the advent of computing. The journey began in the 1940s with the introduction of early computers that did not have an operating system. Programs were loaded manually using switches or punched cards, and these machines could perform only one task at a time."

These systems allowed multiple jobs to be executed sequentially without manual intervention. IBM's General Motors Operating System (GMOS) for the IBM 701 is often cited as one of the earliest operating systems.\"

This era saw the development of the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) at MIT and MULTICS, which introduced concepts such as hierarchical file systems and multi-user capabilities. MULTICS influenced many future operating systems, including UNIX."
